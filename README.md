Party! Yeah!
============

So this is a small mezzanine site I wrote for our engagement party. The primary
motivation for this was to make it super easy for people to RSVP and, along the
way, I got to play with Mezzanine.

Most of this is stock-standard, with a few customisations layered on top of the
theme *Moderna* from thecodinghouse/mezzanine-themes, but the RSVP module was
developed (by me) just for this project.

Setup shouldn't deviate far from the standard Mezzanine process, but because 
I'm a sucker for postgres, you will need to install psycopg2 if it's not around
already.
